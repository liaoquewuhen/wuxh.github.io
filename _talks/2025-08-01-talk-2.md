We present an intelligent insole system based on a flexible textile pressure sensor array for lower-limb motion capture. The system features an exceptional detection range of up to 3770.9 kPa and an ultra-long operational lifespan exceeding 4 million cycles. It achieves human lower-limb joint position prediction with a precision of 3.6 cm, providing a scene-independent, non-intrusive, and motion-unbiased data terminal. This technology serves as a key foundational component for the next-generation human-machine perception fusion systems.
