In this talk, we present a skin-inspired all-textile flexible pressure sensor with a signal transmission layer, addressing the challenges of manufacturing complexity and device longevity in conventional sensor arrays. Our design enables lossless acquisition of localized pressure signals using a single sensor, demonstrating the feasibility of performing complex tasks such as handwritten digit input detection. Key advantages of our approach include:

- High-precision detection of handwritten digits, wrist rotation, and human motion, validating the signal transmission layer's effectiveness in capturing local pressure information.
- Exceptional sensor performance with high sensitivity, ultra-wide detection range, and outstanding mechanical stability, meeting the demands of large-scale and high-cycle applications in flexible wearable devices.
- Simple dip-coating and drying fabrication process for all-textile sensors, offering low-cost, breathable, and comfortable devices compatible with modern textile industry processes, facilitating scalable industrial production.
