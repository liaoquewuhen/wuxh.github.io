This study addresses the challenge of designing all-textile pressure sensors that simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, wide detection range, and long-term durability. Inspired by the tactile perception mechanisms of human skin, we developed a multilayer all-textile pressure sensor using a simple dip-dry fabrication method. The sensor integrates a signal transmission layer, a protective layer, and a sensing layer, enabling it to capture local pressure variations with a single element. It demonstrates high-precision performance in complex tasks such as handwritten digit recognition and human activity monitoring. This work provides a novel, efficient, and cost-effective strategy for developing electronic textiles for human-machine interaction and wearable activity sensing.
