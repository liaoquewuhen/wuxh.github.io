This study addresses the limitations of existing lower-limb motion capture technologies, which are often constrained by the environment, interfere with natural movements, and require cumbersome wearables. We developed an innovative flexible textile-based plantar pressure sensor array. Fabricated through a composite process, the sensor system achieves an ultrawide pressure range, high sensitivity, and exceptional durability. Experiments demonstrate accurate recognition of ten dynamic and static postures with 95.5% accuracy, as well as high-precision joint position prediction with an error of approximately 3.6 cm. This work provides a new approach for developing next-generation “natural human–computer interaction terminals” in extended reality (XR) applications, offering fully untethered, comfortable, and daily-environment-compatible solutions with broad industrial potential.
