This study addresses the technical bottlenecks of high-performance flexible pressure sensors by designing and fabricating an air-cushion comb-like flexible pressure sensor (ALCS) using laser direct writing, inspired by airbag comb structures. By introducing the air-cushion structure to increase contact area variation and incorporating perforations to enhance unit strain, the sensor achieves an ultrawide detection range, high sensitivity, and millisecond-level fast response and recovery. Integrated into a smart glove and combined with machine learning algorithms, the system enables accurate recognition of eight dynamic sign language gestures, providing an efficient communication solution for individuals with speech impairments. Further validation demonstrates precise recognition of 26 virtual keyboard letters, highlighting the sensor's potential in gesture recognition and complex classification tasks.
