The tri-modal sensor array was integrated into an intelligent service robot’s electronic skin and successfully validated in multiple scenarios, including multi-level safety protection, obstacle recognition, gesture interaction, and near-target localization. This work provides a novel multi-modal sensing solution that addresses the trade-off between resolution and detection depth in capacitive flexible proximity–tactile sensors, advancing robotic perception and interaction capabilities, and laying a foundation for practical applications of multi-modal sensors in the future.
